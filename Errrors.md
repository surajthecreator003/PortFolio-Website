-need to fix header for proper allignment when re scrolled back ✔️ 

- need to fix view port to find  main element in display 

- need to fix css animation (context provider working but css aint changing) ✔️

- accidently made the borders glow need to change ✔️

- the dynamic css animation sliding (in header/nav) when navigated to a particular part of page works perfectly on medium and high end device but creats problem on very small devices - probably because of incompatibility of framer motion with the lowest width height percentage or range of the div in tailwind css or normall css generally(Need Deeper research)
   -framer motion catches up to speed in lower end device skipping some part of header for navigation
